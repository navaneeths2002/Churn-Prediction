 üìâ Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Model

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on historical data. Accurate churn prediction allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

## üß† Project Overview

The model uses supervised learning techniques to classify customers as likely to churn (`1`) or not (`0`) based on features such as demographics, usage behavior, subscription details, and more.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Churn prediction on unseen data
- Performance metrics visualization

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset includes information about customers such as:

- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Contract type
- Monthly charges
- Total charges
- Internet service type
- Customer support calls
- ...and other behavior/usage metrics

> Note: You can use any open-source dataset like the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) or your own custom dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## üß™ Model(s) Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost (optional)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

> Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## üîç Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model
- **Precision**: Correctly predicted churns vs. total predicted churns
- **Recall**: Correctly predicted churns vs. actual churns
- **F1-score**: Balance between precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**
